# Article-Classification

In this project, you will use text classification to predict the most relevant news articles for
each of the 10 topics. The practical application of this project can be described as follows:
There are 10 users who like to read news articles. Each user, however, is interested in a
different, single topic. The topics are:
1. ARTS CULTURE ENTERTAINMENT
2. BIOGRAPHIES PERSONALITIES PEOPLE
3. DEFENCE
4. DOMESTIC MARKETS
5. FOREX MARKETS
6. HEALTH
7. MONEY MARKETS
8. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
9. SHARE LISTINGS
10. SPORTS
As a Data Scientist, you are tasked to help these users find the most interesting articles
according to their preferred topics. You have a training dataset containing about 9500 news
articles, each assigned to one of the above topics. In addition, (as in real life situation) the
dataset contains about 48% of irrelevant articles (marked as IRRELEVANT) that do not
belong to any of the topics; hence the users are not interested in them. The distribution of
articles over topics is not uniform. There are some topics with large number of articles, and
some with very small number
